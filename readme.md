## About the Project

This application simulates a basic online store. It allows users to create accounts, browse products, and make purchases. The main purpose of this project is to gain hands-on experience in full-stack web development â€” covering both the frontend (user interface) and backend (server and database integration).

Key features include:
- User registration and authentication
- Product catalog browsing
- Basic shopping cart functionality
- Simulated purchasing process

While the app is not intended for production use, it provides a foundational understanding of how e-commerce websites operate behind the scenes.
